                <td colspan="2">  A collection of web pages which are grouped together and usually connected together in various ways is often called a    "website" or a "site". Web Pages contain text, forms, audio and video files, streaming media, and sometimes games. Every website  may look different, but all have one thing in common: Hyper Text Markup Language (also known as HTML), Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) regularly and Javascript. HTML files which contain HTML code are simple text files that produce web pages.  Just like a text file you create on a Windows computer works on Linux and Mac, webpages works on any other operating system.

                       Web browsers are programs that read HTML and CSS instructions and then use those instructions to make web page content appear on a screen. Always write your HTML with the idea that people will view the content using a web browser. Web browsers request and display web pages that come from a web server on the Internet. But you can also display HTML pages you’ve saved on your own device before making them available on an Internet web server. When you develop your own HTML documents (web pages), you view those pages (called local pages) in your browser. You can use local pages to get a good idea of what people will see after those pages go live on the Internet.

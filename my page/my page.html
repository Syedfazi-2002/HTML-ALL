    Website
     A collection of web pages which are grouped together and usually connected together in various ways is often called a "website" or a "site". Web Pages contain text, forms, audio and video files, streaming media, and sometimes games. Every website may look different, but all have one thing in common: Hyper Text Markup Language (also known as HTML), Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) regularly and Javascript. HTML files which contain HTML code are simple text files that produce web pages.  Just like a text file you create on a Windows computer works on Linux and Mac, webpages works on any other operating system.
